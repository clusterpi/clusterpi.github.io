## Matplotlib

-   *Matplotlib*: Matplotlib is a library that allows us to create nice
    graphs in python. As we typically install python with virtualenv, we
    need to configure matplotlib properly to use it. The easiest way to
    do this is to execute the following commands. After you run them you
    can use matplotlib.

        $ pip install numpy
        $ pip install matplotlib
        $ echo "backend : TkAgg" > ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc


-   [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX) (from Arduino if
    you like to use their interface to access the esp8266 boards)

## Arduino

This installation is optional. In the event that there is a TTY error,
you will need to install Arduino, since your Mac may be missing some
drivers that are included in Arduino. Simply go to
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX) and follow the
installation instructions.
