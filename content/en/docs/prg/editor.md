## Aquaemacs for macOS

There are many different versions of emacs available on OSX. Aquamacs is
often used as it integrates nicely with the OSX GUI interface.

-   [AquaEmacs](http://aquamacs.org/download.shtml)

*Aquamacs* is a program for Mac devices which allows the user to edit
text, HTML, LaTeX, C++, Java, Python, R, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and more.
Aquamacs integrates well with OSX and provides many functions through a
menu. You will mostly be using the File, Edit, menus or toolbar icons.

Emacs provides convenient keyboard shortcuts, most of which are
combinations with the Control or Meta key (The Meta key is the ESC key).
If you accidentally end up doing something wrong simply press `CTRL-g`
to get out without issue. Other Keyboard Shortcuts include:

-   `CTRL-x u` or File\>Undo will cancel any command that you did not
    want done. (CHECK)

-   `ESC-g` will cancel any command you are in the middle of.

-   You can break paragraph lines with `Ctrl-x w`, where `w` will wrap
    text around word boundaries.

-   To delete text to the end of the current word, press `ESC-d`.

-   to delete the whole line from the position of the cursor to the end,
    press `CTRL-k`.
