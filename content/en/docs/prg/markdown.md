MarkDown is a format convention that produces nicely formatted text with
simple ASCII text. Markdown has very good support for editors that
render the final output in a view window next to the editor pane. Two
such editors are

-   [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/): MacDown provides a nice
    integrated editor that works well.

-   [pyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=mac&code=PCC):
    We have successfully used Vladimir Schhneiders [Markdown Navigator
    plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896-markdown-navigator).
    Once installed you click on a .md file pycharm will automatically
    ask to install the plugins from Markdown for you.

Links for markdown include

-   [Macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) a macdown editor for macOS

-   [Markdown](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) (from Markdown)


A detailed set of syntax rules can be found at: **BUG: LINK TO MARKDOWN

The following are some basic examples

-   To *emphasise* a text you use `*emphasize*`

-   To make text **bold** use `**bold**`

-   To make text ***bold-and-emphasize*** use `***bold-and-emphasize***`

-   To create a hyperlink use `[Google](https://google.com)` which will
    result in [Google](https://google.com)

-   To include an image use `![Bracketed Text](link)`

A list can be created by item starting with \*, a - , or a + or a number

    1. one
    2. two

1.  one

2.  two

        * one
        * two

If you need to indent items underneath already bulleted items, precede
the indent items with four spaces and they will be nested under the item
previous to them.

To qoute textc precede it with a "\>".
