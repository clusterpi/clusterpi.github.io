[Raspberry PI's](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) are a convenient cheap
compute platform that allow us to explore create cloud clusters
with various software that otherwise
would not be accessible to most. The point is not to create a complex
compute platform, but to create a *testbed* in which we can explore
configuration aspects and prepare benchmarks that are run on larger
and expensive cloud environments. In addition Raspberry Pis can be used
as a simple Linux terminal to log into other machines.

We will give a small introduction to the platform next.
