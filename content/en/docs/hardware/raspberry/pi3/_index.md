title: "Raspberry Pi 3b+"
linkTitle: "3b+"
description: >
  The PI 3 provides a complete Linux OS that is useful for most projects. Consider however using the new PI4.
---

Note: a new version 4 has come out and we recommend to use
that.

The raspberry PI 3B+ is a very good development platform. With its base
price of \$35 it is quite a bargain. You will need some additional
components to make sure you can use it. Please be reminded to never
connect or power the raspberry with your computers USB port. It draws
some significant amperage and we do not want you to destroy your
computer. We recommend that you buy a certified power adapter. The price
is so cheap that you could even create your own mini cluster as a
project. We do not recommend any older versions of Raspberry as they are
less powerful and do not contain built-in Bluetooth or WiFi.

    This is an aftermarket power adapter. Lots uof us use this one.

-   \$6.99 [HDMI
    cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Standard/dp/B014I8SSD0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1499253502&sr=8-3&keywords=hdmi+cable)

-   Monitor/TV with hdmi

-   [SD Card 32GB](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B073JWXGNT/ref=asc_df_B073JWXGNT/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309776868400&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13189001702770838448&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016563&hvtargid=pla-348080513499&psc=1)

*Advantages:*

-   Full Linux like OS based on debian

-   Good environment for learning Linux and Python

-   Reasonable interfaces to IoT sensors

-   Excellent camera support

-   Excellent choice of expansion packages including Grove Sensors that
    make it easy to attach sensors and actuators. An example package is
    the [Grove Starter
    Kit](https://www.amazon.com/GrovePi-Starter-Kit-Dexter-Industries/dp/B00TXTZ5SQ/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_147_bs_tr_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=45QX6XSNZAG1NT8NES79)
    for about \$90


## Pin Layout

The PI 3B, 3B+ and Zero come with a number of pins that can be used to
attach sensors. It is convenient to have the pinout available for your
project. Hence we provide a pinout layout in @fig:pi-layout. Other
Pis will have a differnt pinout and you will have to locate them on
the internet.
