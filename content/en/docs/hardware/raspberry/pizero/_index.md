Note: Pi Zero W comes with WIFI. Make sure you get this one.


In addition to the the bigger PI's another interesting platform is the
PI Zero, which is a very low cost system that can serve as IoT
board. However it is also powerful enough to run more sophisticated
applications on it. The newest Raspberry PI Zero is shown in
@fig:pizero.

The board has the following properties:

* 1GHz single-core CPU
* 512MB RAM
* Mini HDMI port
* Micro USB OTG port
* Micro USB power
* HAT-compatible 40-pin header
* Composite video and reset headers
* CSI camera connector (v1.3 only)

## Pin Layout

The PI 3B, 3B+ and Zero come with a number of pins that can be used to
attach sensors. It is convenient to have the pinout available for your
project. Hence we provide a pinout layout in @fig:pi-layout. Other
Pis will have a differnt pinout and you will have to locate them on
the internet.
