IoT Sensor Kits
{{% /pageinfo %}}

There are meny sensor kits that you can purchase. SOme require you to
use breadboards, while others are haveing ready made plugs.
The breadboards are typically more difficult to put together. If in
doubt and you use Raspberry Pis, we recommend to use GrovePI.
You find links to them in our Web page.

In our IoT Section you will also find information about specific sensors.

## Sensor Kit

It is fun to attach sensors to your IoT board. There are many kits
available and we encourage you to do comparisons. One such kit is

-   \$29.99 [Elegoo 37

However it does not include a breadboard like other kits. Hence we
recommend that you get a breadboard as it makes experimenting easier.
