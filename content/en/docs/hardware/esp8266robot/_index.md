  A very cheap robot car can be created with an ESP8266.

The ESP8266 has many variants. Some of which are difficult to interface
with. However, this does not apply for the ESP8266 NodeMCU. This board
is originally flashed with *Lua*, however it can easily be reflashed
with MicroPython. In addition it is often offered as part of a platform
to develop a robot car. There are arguably better kits available, but
the price of \$24 for the entire kit is hard to beat. Unfortunately the
version of python, as well as the limited memory make the esp8266 not a
full fledged platform for python programming and you will quickly see
its limitations. Interfacing with it, however, as an IoT device will
gain you a lot of insights.

*Configuration:*

-   \$7.99  [esp8266 &

-   4 \* AA Rechargable Batteries & charger

Optionally you may want to get additional sensors such as wheel Encoders

-  \$9.99 [Wheel Encoder](https://www.amazon.com/Wheel-Encoder-Kit-Robot-Car/dp/B00NPWGEIM/ref=sr_1_4?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1499254488&sr=1-4&keywords=speed+sensor+robot+car+wheel)

We have not use the encoder much

*Advantages:*

-   Very low price for what it can do

-   We have macOS software available that makes it easy to setup (Other
    tutorials for other platforms are available on the internet, you can
    contribute by creating documentation we distribute in class for
    points)

## Alternative Parts

There are many alternatives available to build a car chasis. Two examples are her. One of them uses not the ESP8266 but an Arduino.
