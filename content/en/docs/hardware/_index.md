Information about the hardware that you can use for projects
{{% /pageinfo %}}

When teaching programming you may find yourself in a situation that
things can be done on your computer, but you may not want to install
programs that help you to learn programming on your computer. However,
we have a solution (or several) for you. We will have some fun with
hardware for IoT that at the same time can be used to teach you some
very elementary skills in programming. However, if you would rather use
your computer you certainly can do this too.

We see the following arguments for using IoT hardware:

-   You will have fun with inexpensive hardware

-   You will get hands on experience with IOT devices

-   You will learn how to program in python

-   You can keep your current computer unchanged

-   You will get experience with two platforms esp8266 and Raspberry PI
    3

-   You can customise your choices by conducting some fun projects.

-   You have the opportunity to find alternative hardware choices such
    as the WiPy or the ESP32. You may find cheaper or better
    alternatives if you buy kits when they are available. And learn in
    getting an overview about such devices and kits.

*Note:* Ordering from overseas suppliers may take significant time, so
make sure to plan ahead. Prices given here are done to provide an
estimate, they may vary.
