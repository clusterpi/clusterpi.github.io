SD Card writers are needed to place the OS on a PI.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

You will need a good SDCard Writer. We recommend to use one with USB
3.0 as they are quicker than the 2.0 in case you have a laptop that
supports them. As you may wantt o also use the writer on your PI make
sure you have aporpriate adapters of blugs for this isn case you need
bth USB-C and regular USB.

## Adapters

Dependent what USB plug you have you may need an additional adaptor.
Please remember that We need to burn on the PI as well as your regular
Laptop.

If you need to go the other way round and have only the usbc version you need also this. Maybe better to go with a regular one

## USB C Hubs

There are nice USB C HUbs available that not only have a writer but
also additional ports. They are quite useful and you may want to
consider them. We have not tried to use them on a Raspbery PY with an
appropriate adapter yet. So they may not work. Send us a message so we
learn from you.

The following has received good ratings. However, the design is a bit
akwared and it broke after 6 month.

## USB 3 Writer

We have used the following writer as it is relatively cheap and USB 3.
Howeverthey are huge. They are 3 quater the size of a hub.

If you find a cheaper USB3 writer that works well elt us know.

## USB 2 Writer

We used to have lots of the follwoing, but they break down easily.
However, a student has put the SDCards in the wrong
way into them and rammed them into the slot not just breaking the
writer but also the card. We are still to date puzzled why there could
be a confusion. We assume that and SD Crad reader would break if
treated that way.
