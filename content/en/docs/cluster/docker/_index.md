Here we gather some documents about Docker.

Docker is a tool that allows us to deploy applications inside of
software containers. A container allows a developer to package the
application along with dependencies associated with it and put all in
a box which is an isolated environment so that the underlying host
operating system is completely abstracted from the application running
inside the box.

It is a method of packaging software, to include not only our code,
but also other components such as a full file system, system tools,
services, and libraries. This can be useful for the Raspberry Pi
because it allows users to run applications without lot of steps, as
long as the application is packaged inside of a Docker image. We
simply install Docker and run the container.

According to the developers of Docker it includes the following features:

* Portability
* Density
* Scalability
* Security
