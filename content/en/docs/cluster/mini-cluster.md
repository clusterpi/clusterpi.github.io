## Progress

### Week 1

- [x] Distributed mini cluster equipment
- [ ] Set up cluster with cloudmesh-pi-burn
- [ ] Get more SD Cards
- [ ] Add more tasks ... ;-)
- [ ] Add more weeks ... ;-)
- [ ] Add dates to Weeks ... ;-)
- [ ] Add weekly meeting
- [ ] Add slack to web page: <https://app.slack.com/client/TFQC2P62D/CTP848QDV>
- [ ] Is there a build in slack module for hugo?

## Week 2

- [ ] find k3s and see if that can be set up. Remember they may do it
  differently than we need. We assume a cluster network is setup. We
  need to build form existing cluster with network. Can k3s do this?
  Evaluate report.
- [ ] By end of week 2 we want a mechnaism to set up while using
  cloudmesh-pi-burn before hand
