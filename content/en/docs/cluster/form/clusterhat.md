## ClusterHat (4 Zero + 1 Pi)


The smallest cluster we came across is actually a hybrid cluster in
which 4 Pi zeros attached to a Raspberry Pi 3. This sis achieved via an
add on board to the Pi 3 allowing to plug in PI=i Zeros:

The Cluster HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) allows to attach 4 Raspberry
Pi Zeros via to be attached to a regular Raspberry PI 3 to simulate a
small cluster.

According to the Web Site it supports the following features:

-   USB Gadget Mode: Ethernet and Serial Console.
-   Onboard 4 port USB 2.0 hub.
-   Raspberry Pi Zeros powered via Controller Pi GPIO (USB optional).
-   Individual Raspberry Pi Zero power controlled via the Controller Pi
    GPIO (I2C).
-   Connector for Controller Serial Console (FTDI Basic).
-   Controller Pi can be rebooted without interrupting power to Pi Zeros
    (network recovers on boot).

Although this setup seems rather appealing, the issue is with obtaining
Pi Zeros for the regional price of $5. Typically users can only by one
for that price and must pay shipping. To by more one has to buy a kit
for about $20. However, for that amount of money it may just be worth
while to get Pi 3's instead of zero's. Nevertheless the form factor is
rather appealing.
