## Bitscope Case (40 Pi's)


A company from Australia called BitScope Designs offers a number of
cases that leverage their Pi Blade boards allowing up to four Pis to be
put together and sharing the same power supply. The blades are shown
in the next Figure. The rack to place 10 of them is shown in the
Figure after that.

The cost of the blade rack is $ 795.45 + $60.00 shipping + import tax.
This may originally sound expensive when compared to a single case,
however as we can store 40 Pis in them and they can share the
power-supply and reduce cabling we think this case is quite interesting
overall due to its price-point of $20 per Pi.

## BitScope Cluster (144 Pi's)

Together with LANL a new cluster module that holds 144 Pis is developed.
This system is targeted to be placed into a rack to create a large Pi
cluster. The cost for such a module is about $15K.


The next Figure shows the module.

The next figure shows how multiple modules can be placed into a
single rack.
