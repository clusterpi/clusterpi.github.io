Although a NAS is not really a compute cluster the Pi has used many
times to build a Network Attached Storage (NAS) server. In this
configuration a HDD is attached to the Raspberry and the network
features of the Raspberry is used to access the disk drive via software
installed on the PI that make this easily possible. Many tutorials
exists on the Web that help setting op such a device.

We like to hear from you if you have successfully developed such a NAS
and provide us with such links. Links that may help include:
